  "projectOverview": {
    "productName": "Just Start",
    "description": "Just Start is an AI-powered PRD (Product Requirements Document) generator that helps entrepreneurs and developers think deeply about their project before jumping into development. Through an intelligent question-and-answer flow, it guides users to clarify their vision, research optimal tech stacks, and generate comprehensive product specifications—transforming vague ideas into actionable development plans.",
    "targetAudience": "Non-technical founders, solo developers, and small development teams who want to validate and structure their app ideas before writing code. Particularly valuable for first-time builders who may lack experience in product planning or technical architecture decisions."
  },
  "purposeAndGoals": {
    "problemStatement": "Most developers and entrepreneurs rush into coding without properly thinking through their product strategy, tech stack choices, and feature requirements. This leads to wasted time building the wrong features, choosing incompatible technologies, discovering major flaws mid-development, and ultimately rebuilding entire applications. The enthusiasm to 'just start coding' often results in technical debt, scope creep, and abandoned projects.",
    "solution": "Just Start acts as a thoughtful co-pilot that slows users down (in a good way) by asking the right questions upfront. It uses AI to generate clarifying questions based on the user's initial app description, researches current best practices for tech stack recommendations, validates technology compatibility, and outputs a production-ready PRD in a structured format. This ensures users have a solid plan before writing their first line of code.",
    "keyObjectives": [
      "Help users articulate their app vision clearly through guided questioning",
      "Reduce technical decision paralysis by providing researched, justified tech stack recommendations",
      "Prevent costly mid-development pivots by identifying potential issues early",
      "Generate professional-grade PRDs that serve as both planning documents and developer handoff materials",
      "Make product planning accessible to non-technical founders who may hire developers later",
      "Save 10-20 hours of research and documentation time per project"

        "Requires learning Convex-specific patterns if team only knows traditional REST APIs"
      ]
    },
    "database": {
      "technology": "Convex (integrated NoSQL database)",
      "reasoning": "Convex provides an integrated document database that's optimized for real-time applications. Since it's part of the Convex platform, there's no separate database to configure, secure, or scale. The schema is defined in TypeScript code, which provides type safety and makes it easy to evolve the data model. Documents can have flexible schemas, which is perfect for storing varied PRD structures as they evolve.",
      "prosForThisProject": [

    "designApproach": "Just Start uses a clean, minimal design that reduces cognitive load during a potentially overwhelming planning process. The UI should feel like a conversation with a helpful advisor, not a complex form. Progressive disclosure: show only what's needed at each step. Use micro-interactions and animations to provide feedback during AI processing. Emphasize clarity over cleverness—users should always know where they are, what's happening, and what comes next. Design inspiration: Linear's clean workflows, Stripe's documentation clarity, and Notion's delightful interactions. Color palette: primary blue for CTAs, soft grays for backgrounds, green for success states, amber for warnings, red for critical issues.",

    "styleGuidelines": "Typography: Use Inter or Geist for UI text (clean, highly readable). JetBrains Mono for code snippets in PRDs. Font sizes: 14px base, 12px for labels, 20-28px for headings. Spacing: 8px base unit, multiples of 8 for consistent rhythm. Components: Use shadcn/ui components for consistency (Button, Card, Dialog, Form, Progress, Tabs, Toast). Customize colors to match brand. Interactions: 200ms transitions for hover states, subtle scale on button press, loading spinners for async actions, toast notifications for success/error messages. Accessibility: WCAG AA compliant, keyboard navigation for all interactions, focus states clearly visible, color not the only indicator of state, alt text for all images. Responsive: Mobile-first design, stack content vertically on mobile, enlarge touch targets to 44x44px minimum, test on iPhone SE, Pixel, and iPad sizes."
